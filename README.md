-I learned that quantifiers are existential if there is an x that will make the function P(x) true and Universal if all x makes P(x) true.
-I also studied proving and I practiced proving with logical equivalences and laws from identity laws to absorption laws and I practiced  

#Week 3
-I learned how to use proving statements using direct logic, contraposition (indirect) and contradiction. 
-I learned that you can use rules on inference to prove statements with their equivalences.
