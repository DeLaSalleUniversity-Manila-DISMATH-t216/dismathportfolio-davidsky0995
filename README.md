#Week 1
-I learned that validity is different from the truth. Validity leans more on the rightness of the equation while truth is based
more on real life situations.

-I also learned how to use the truth table as a tool for proving statements.

#Week 2

-I learned that quantifiers are existential if there is an x that will make the function P(x) true.

-Quantifier is Universal if all x makes P(x) true.

-I also studied proving and I practiced proving with logical equivalences and laws from identity laws to absorption laws.

#Week 3

-I learned how to use proving statements using direct logic, contraposition (indirect) and contradiction. 

-I learned that you can use rules on inference to prove statements with their equivalences.

#Week 4

-Mathematical induction was familiar to me, but the lesson was more detailed and I learned that there are detailed steps like the basis step and indution step.

-The basis step is needed for validity of the equation to be used. 

-When disproving something, all you need is a counter example. 

-Recursive is a detailed definition for a certain equation or function.

#Week 5

-Recursive goes back to the previous equation to answer the current equation.

-Recursive algorithm solves a problem by reducing it to the same problem with smaller input.

-There are two steps in Mathematical Induction:

* Basis rule (It's like substitution to show that the equation used is valid and applicable.)
* Induction (Actually showing that the two equaitons are equal by manipulating the equations to make the left and rights side equal.

*Set - An unordered collention of distinct objects.

*Subset - A set B within a set S. [S={{B}}]

*Power Set - The set of all subsets of the main set.

*Cardinality - Number of elements a set contains.
